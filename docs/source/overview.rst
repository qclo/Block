Use Block with PySCF package
============================

Block program supports two executing modes: running standalone through command
line or as a plugin of other quantum chemistry package.  The Python-based
quantum chemistry program package `PySCF <http://www.pyscf.org>`_ provides a
simple solution to run Block program.  It is the recommended way to use
Block program in most scenario.  Please see the userguide :ref:`dmrg_pyscf`.

.. Calling `BLOCK` as an external function
.. =======================================
.. 
.. The makefile distributed with `Block` code can be used to generate a library file called
.. libqcdmrg.a. 
.. To call `Block` as a subroutine from a C++ program, the library file has to be
.. linked to the program. 
.. A DMRG calculation can be performed using the function call ``calldmrg(inputf, outputf)``,
.. where ``inputf`` and ``outputf`` are C-style character arrays specifying the `Block` input and output fies respectively.
